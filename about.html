        <p class="muted">Senior level HR judgment for moments where the stakes are real.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <p>Most HR advice fails because it assumes every organization operates under the same conditions. A compliance framework that works for a stable mid sized company will break under rapid growth. A policy designed for low risk industries will not survive scrutiny in healthcare or financial services. The difference between sound HR strategy and costly mistakes often comes down to judgment, context, and knowing which variables actually matter.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <p>Dominique E. Thomas brings that judgment through more than 15 years of senior level HR experience advising organizations at critical moments. Her career has been built in outsourced HR consulting, supporting growth stage companies and established enterprises across technology, professional services, healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services. Rather than refining HR for a single organization, she has built, scaled, and remediated HR systems for over a thousand companies supporting tens of thousands of employees across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <p>She understands exactly when organizations realize they need experienced HR leadership. It often surfaces during moments of pressure: preparing for acquisition while compliance gaps emerge, managing high risk employee relations matters, scaling beyond the limits of informal HR processes, or responding to legal challenges tied to misclassification, leave administration, or documentation failures. Dominique has managed hundreds of high risk employee relations cases annually and led HR transformations that reduced litigation exposure, increased operational efficiency, and strengthened leadership decision making.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <div class="kicker">Approach</div>
        <p>Her approach is deliberately different from standard consulting models. Dominique does not begin with HR best practices and attempt to force them into place. She starts with the organization’s reality: risk tolerance, culture, leadership capability, and operational constraints. Every recommendation is grounded in a risk weighted decision framework that makes trade offs explicit, allowing leaders to understand the cost, impact, and exposure associated with each option.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <p>In 2024, Dominique launched her independent advisory practice to address a consistent gap in the market. Organizations facing genuine complexity need experienced HR counsel, not volume driven solutions or templated guidance. Her model prioritizes depth, discretion, and strategic thinking, supporting leaders who need clarity when decisions carry real legal, financial, and cultural consequences.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <p>HR done well is not about eliminating risk entirely. It is about making informed decisions quickly, with a clear understanding of what is at stake. Dominique provides senior level HR perspective without the overhead of a full time executive, offering leaders the confidence that comes from working with someone who has navigated these challenges successfully across many contexts.</p>
