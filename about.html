            Dominique E. Thomas designs the people, policy, and leadership systems organizations rely on during growth, complexity, and transition. She is known for seeing the full picture quickly, addressing root cause rather than symptoms, and building solutions that hold up long after the engagement ends.

          <h2>Builds the systems. Leads the work. Gets it right.</h2>
          <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72;">Dominique's work is defined by its precision and its durability. She doesn't build things that need to be rebuilt. Whether the engagement is a compliance framework, a performance architecture, or a full HR infrastructure, what she delivers is designed to hold up — under growth, under scrutiny, and under pressure.</p>
          <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72;">She holds all stakeholders in view simultaneously — employees, managers, executives, and the organization itself — and designs responses that account for each of them. The immediate situation and the systemic conditions that created it are both on the table, every time.</p>

        <h2>A decade of senior leadership that made all of it possible.</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72;">The range and precision of Dominique's work today was shaped by a decade in senior leadership at a national HR services organization — an environment that required advising across more than 1,100 client companies and 26,000 employees simultaneously, spanning industries, company sizes, and HR challenges of every kind.</p>
        <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72;">Those clients spanned every industry: healthcare, manufacturing, professional services, nonprofit, hospitality, retail, and more. They ranged from early-stage companies building their first HR function to established mid-market organizations managing multi-state workforces. No two situations were the same, and the volume meant there was no room to be anything but sharp.</p>
        <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72;">That environment required genuine fluency across the full spectrum of HR: employment law and multi-state compliance, employee relations and investigations, leave administration, performance management, leadership development, HRIS implementation, and org design. The expertise she brings to clients today was not assembled over time. It was built all at once, under pressure, at scale.</p>
        <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72; margin-bottom: 0;">What that decade produced was a practitioner who has seen nearly every people challenge an organization can face and knows how to respond to each of them with precision. That is the foundation she brings to every engagement today.</p>
