        <h1>What I work on</h1>
        <p class="small">
          My work covers the full range of people and HR challenges — from building the right systems as you grow, to handling the situations that keep leaders up at night.

          <h2>People &amp; Organizational Design</h2>
          <p class="small">
            I help organizations build the structures and systems that let people do their best work — and that hold up as the company grows or changes. This means thinking through how teams are organized, how accountability works, and how HR operations actually run day to day.
          </p>
          <ul class="small">
            <li>Performance management systems</li>
            <li>Organizational design and role clarity</li>
            <li>People infrastructure for startups and high-growth companies</li>
            <li>Workforce planning and analytics</li>
            <li>HR operations and technology</li>

          <h2>Risk, Compliance &amp; Employee Relations</h2>
          <p class="small">
            HR issues don't stay small for long if they're not handled well. I help organizations stay ahead of people-related risk — through solid policies, thoughtful escalation frameworks, and consistent decision-making that holds up under scrutiny.
          </p>
          <ul class="small">
            <li>Multi-state and federal employment compliance</li>

          <h2>Leadership &amp; Decision Support</h2>
          <p class="small">
            Sometimes leaders just need someone they trust to think through a hard situation with them. I provide that — clear-headed, experienced support at moments where getting it right really matters.

          <h2>Advisory &amp; Fractional HR Leadership</h2>
          <p class="small">
            For organizations that need senior HR expertise without a full-time hire, I can step in as a steady, trusted partner — embedded in the work and available when things get complicated.

          The best way to figure out whether I can help is just to have a conversation. Tell me what's going on, and we'll take it from there.
