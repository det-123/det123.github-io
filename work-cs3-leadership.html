      <p class="cs-lead">Promoting strong individual contributors into management without preparation is one of the most common — and costly — mistakes a fast-growing company can make. This engagement was designed to reverse the damage and build the leadership layer the organization actually needed.</p>

          <h2>Scaled from 20 to 120 in 18 months. The management layer didn't keep up.</h2>
          <p>The company had grown at a pace most startups dream about. Product-market fit arrived fast, hiring followed, and headcount grew from 20 to 120 employees in under two years. The founding team was rightly proud of what they had built.</p>
          <p>But the management layer that formed during that growth had a serious problem. When new manager roles opened up, the default decision was to promote the best performers on each team. That instinct is understandable — and it's almost always the wrong move without intentional preparation. Being exceptional at a job and being equipped to lead others in that job are entirely different skills, and the company had treated them as the same thing.</p>
          <p>By the time the engagement started, the signs were hard to ignore. Performance was declining on three of the company's highest-growth teams. Attrition had ticked up among strong individual contributors who cited their managers in exit conversations. Two formal HR complaints had been filed against managers in a six-month period — both related to how performance issues had been handled, or more accurately, how they hadn't been.</p>
          <p>Senior leadership knew they had a management problem. What they didn't fully see yet was that they also had a senior leadership problem — because the expectations they held for their managers had never been clearly communicated, and the behavior they were modeling wasn't always what they were asking managers to replicate.</p>

      <h2>Built from the top down and the inside out.</h2>
      <p style="color: var(--muted); max-width: 640px; margin-bottom: 48px;">The program had four components, delivered in parallel over three months. Critically, the engagement started with senior leadership — not managers — because without alignment at the top, any development program risks teaching managers to operate differently than the culture actually rewards.</p>

      <div class="cs-phases">

          <div class="cs-phase-body">
            <h3>Senior leadership alignment</h3>
            <p>Before a single manager development session was delivered, a structured working session was held with the senior leadership team. The goal was to surface and codify what they actually expected from managers — not in aspirational terms, but in concrete behavioral ones. What did a good performance conversation look like? What was the threshold for escalating an employee issue to HR? What did accountability mean in this organization, and how was it modeled at the top?</p>
            <p>This session surfaced real gaps. Several expectations that senior leaders held with conviction had never been communicated to managers. Some things being asked of managers contradicted what senior leaders were visibly doing themselves. Naming those gaps directly — with honesty and without blame — was the foundation everything else was built on.</p>

        </div>

          <div class="cs-phase-body">
            <h3>Four interactive workshops</h3>
            <p>Four facilitated sessions were delivered to the full manager cohort of 15 over the three-month period. Each session was built around a core leadership competency identified during the senior alignment work:</p>
            <ul style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7; padding-left: 20px; margin: 16px 0;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong style="color: var(--text);">Setting expectations and accountability</strong> — how to define what good looks like, communicate it clearly, and follow through consistently</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong style="color: var(--text);">Performance conversations</strong> — how to give feedback that lands, address underperformance early, and document in a way that is both fair and defensible</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong style="color: var(--text);">Team alignment and psychological safety</strong> — how to build environments where people do their best work and problems surface before they become complaints</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong style="color: var(--text);">Managing up</strong> — how to communicate effectively with senior leadership, surface issues early, and operate with appropriate autonomy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sessions were scenario-based and active. Managers worked through situations drawn from their own teams, practiced difficult conversations with structured feedback, and left each session with a specific commitment to apply before the next.</p>

          <div class="cs-phase-body">
            <h3>Individual coaching</h3>
            <p>Each of the 15 managers received individual coaching sessions structured around their specific development areas and the situations they were navigating in real time. For several managers, this included direct support on active performance issues — helping them handle those conversations in a way that was fair, properly documented, and consistent with organizational expectations.</p>
            <p>Coaching conversations were confidential. Themes that emerged were aggregated and shared with senior leadership in anonymized form as part of the mid-point and close-out debriefs — giving leadership a view into what was actually happening at the manager level without compromising individual trust.</p>

          <div class="cs-phase-body">
            <h3>Program materials and toolkits</h3>
            <p>A suite of practical tools was developed alongside the workshop content — designed to be used on the job, not filed away. These included a performance conversation framework with sample language for common scenarios, a documentation guide covering what to capture, how, and when, a team alignment self-assessment, and a manager expectations reference guide tied directly to what senior leadership had defined in the alignment session.</p>
            <p>These materials also served as onboarding tools — ensuring that managers hired after the program would receive the same foundation as those who participated in it.</p>

          <h2>Managers who could lead — and a senior team aligned around what that meant.</h2>
          <p>By the close of the engagement, managers had a shared language for what good leadership looked like at this company, practical tools they were actively using, and individual coaching support that had helped several of them navigate real situations more effectively than they would have otherwise.</p>
          <p>Three managers who had been avoiding active performance situations initiated and documented those conversations during the program — in each case reaching a better outcome than they had anticipated. The two prior HR complaints, reviewed in light of the new frameworks, informed specific adjustments to how those managers now handled sensitive conversations.</p>
          <p>The close-out debrief with senior leadership surfaced two organizational conditions that had been making good management harder: an unclear promotion process that was creating unhealthy competition between peers, and a pattern of senior leaders bypassing managers to communicate directly with their teams. Both were addressed through process changes at the senior level, extending the program's impact beyond the manager cohort itself.</p>
